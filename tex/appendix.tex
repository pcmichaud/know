This online appendix contains additional results of simulations reported in the text. In the first part, we present results for three extensions discussed in the text: a simulation where we only allow for initial differences in financial knowledge but no accumulation (or decumulation) during the life-cycle, a second reporting results of policy simulations with learning-by-doing instead of the investment mechanism used in our preferred specification and last, a table reporting detailed results for a simulation with decreasing relative risk aversion. The second part reports all parameter values used in baseline specification of the model. The third part contains detailed simulation results for each of the simulations reported in the tables and figures. We report estimates for five-year age groups from age 35 to 75 and for all three education groups.

\caption{\textbf{Statistics from baseline scenario adding differences in initial financial knowledge}. We take initial levels of financial knowledge from Figure 3 using the 2012 NFCS (0 for less than high school, 6.2 for high school graduates and 21.5\% for college graduates).  We report median wealth, average financial knowledge, participation in sophisticated technology, average share of wealth devoted to sophisticated products conditional on participating, and average net household income. The ratio of wealth-to-income for college + graduates to high school dropouts is 1.76.}
